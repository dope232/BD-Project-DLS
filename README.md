# Distributed Logging System

In a microservices architecture, effective log management is crucial for operational excellence. This project aims to streamline the collection, storage, and analysis of logs generated by various services, enhancing the ability to track application behavior and identify errors quickly. By capturing relevant metadata alongside each log entry and enabling real-time ingestion and querying, the system improves operational visibility and facilitates proactive responses to potential issues. Ultimately, this distributed logging framework enhances resilience and maintainability in a dynamic application landscape.
